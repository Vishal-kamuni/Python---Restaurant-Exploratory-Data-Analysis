# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis  
**A Complete Exploratory Data Analysis Project | Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**.  
It focuses on analyzing a real-world restaurant dataset using Python and performing insights-driven **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** across multiple levels.

The goal was to:
- Understand customer ratings and feedback
- Analyze restaurant services like online delivery and table booking
- Explore cuisine popularity and pricing
- Simulate and analyze text-based reviews (Level 3 - NLP)

---

## 🚀 Project Structure

The project is organized into **3 levels**:

### 🔹 Level 1 – Data Cleaning & EDA
- Removed duplicates and nulls
- Renamed and standardized columns
- Performed univariate & bivariate analysis
- Visualized cuisine types, price ranges, and city-based patterns

### 🔹 Level 2 – Advanced Analysis
- Analyzed cuisine combinations
- Explored price vs service availability
- Examined chain performance and vote distributions
- Used geospatial data for mapping restaurant clusters

### 🔹 Level 3 – Text Analysis (NLP)
- Simulated customer review text based on ratings
- Preprocessed, tokenized, and filtered text
- Extracted positive and negative keywords
- Created WordClouds and sentiment-based visuals

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualizations  
- **NLTK** for basic NLP & text analysis  
- **WordCloud** for sentiment visuals  
- **Google Colab Notebook** for development

## 📌 Key Insights

- North Indian and Chinese are the most common cuisines  
- New Delhi has the most restaurants, but smaller cities like Chandigarh have higher ratings  
- Votes moderately correlate with ratings; price does not  
- Online delivery is more common in low-budget restaurants  
- Simulated text reviews reflect strong sentiment patterns
